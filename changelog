Update 3:

This addon has been completely overhauled to use the new AlyxLib scripting system. It requires the AlyxLib addon to be downloaded and enabled.

Added the ability to track ammo and items with an alternate tracking mode.

Added console variables to disable ammo or item tracking if desired.

Moved the attaching to the new Wrist Attachment class in AlyxLib.


[b]The transition to the new AlyxLib API is a complex update so please bear with me during this time. I do this as a hobby and cannot always dedicate my time to fixes.[/b]

Update 2:

Further fix for Scalable Init Support.

Due to the issue only being present in workshop downloads, updates will continue as I narrow down the exact cause.

Update 1:

Fixed script discrepancy which stopped Scalable Init Support from working. The Body Holsters mod now works alongside Resin Watch.
