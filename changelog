Update 4:

Updated to AlyxLib v1.3.0

Added a new custom resin watch model made by TeamSpen210.

Integrated addon with new AlyxLib diagnostic system.

Added resin_watch_reset_watch command.

Added detection for primary hand being changed.

Lowered the entity tracking update time from 60 seconds to 30 seconds. Entities that spawn in mid-game will take up to this long to be recognized.

Fixed the entity tracking not updating when changing resin_watch_allow_ammo_tracking or resin_watch_allow_item_tracking.

Moved the watch closer to the wrist like it used to be.

Update 3:

This addon has been completely overhauled to use the new AlyxLib scripting system. It requires the AlyxLib addon to be downloaded and enabled.

Added the ability to track ammo and items with an alternate tracking mode.

Added console variables to disable ammo or item tracking if desired.

Moved the attaching to the new Wrist Attachment class in AlyxLib.


[b]The transition to the new AlyxLib API is a complex update so please bear with me during this time. I do this as a hobby and cannot always dedicate my time to fixes.[/b]

Update 2:

Further fix for Scalable Init Support.

Due to the issue only being present in workshop downloads, updates will continue as I narrow down the exact cause.

Update 1:

Fixed script discrepancy which stopped Scalable Init Support from working. The Body Holsters mod now works alongside Resin Watch.
