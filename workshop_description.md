[h1]Resin Watch[/h1]

Keep track of resin in the map using this watch with a nearby indicator and total resin counter so you'll never miss an upgrade!

[i]This addon is compatible with Scalable Init Support but does not require it.[/i]

[h2]How To Use[/h2]

Tilt your non-dominant hand to your face as you would to see your health and look at the watch attached to wrist.
The main center screen will light up with a directional indicator when resin is nearby and will point to the nearest piece.
The counter at the top of the watch displays how much resin is left in the map.

As you explore the map your resin watch will beep and vibrate your controller whenever a new piece of resin is nearby to notify you.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]

The watch model has no underside and was quickly put together by modifying a base asset. If you are a modeller and want to create a custom watch model for this addon please get in touch!

The directional indicator does not correctly point to resin when the watch is upside down (hard to notice unless you hold the watch over your head with inverted mode).

The watch will not track resin that has not been spawned yet, because of this the counter might not appear consistent but this is normal behaviour.
